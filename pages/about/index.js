                Fortunately, my thirst for knowledge did not come to an end when
                I was at school. I was passionate about math, biology, and
                technology. This passion helped me gain a profound knowledge of
                these areas especialy in computer & technology.

                I have come to believe that two main factors determine success.
                The first is a personâ€™s determination and will to succeed.
                <p className="mt-4"></p>Are you ready to make sacrifices to
                achieve your goal?
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Are you prepared to recover after failure and proceed to your
                goal again?
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Second one is the support of people around you. Being determined
                to succeed does not mean alienating everyone and stepping on
                other people to achieve your goal. On the contrary, success is
                about recognizing your weaknesses and accepting support from
                people who genuinely want to help you.
